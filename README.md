# Palmbot
Palmbot is a open-source, lightweight Discord bot created using the discord.py library. 

Equipped with handy slash-commands to streamline your school-related tasks and activities, Palmbot is ideal for school club servers and study groups. 

New features will be added over time.

This bot is made by a grade 12 student in Palmer Secondary as his Capstone project :)
